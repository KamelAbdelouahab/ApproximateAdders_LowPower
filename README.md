# Low Power Approximate Adders
This repository contains MATLAB, and VHDL models of Low Power Adders, also called IMPACT adders.

The “lpACLib” library contains the VHDL description of accurate and approximate versions of several arithmetic modules (like adders and multiplier of different bit-widths) and accelerators. Moreover, it also provides the corresponding software behavioral models/implementations developed in C and MATLAB to enable quality characterization. Besides our novel designs, it also contains implementations for several state-of-the-art arithmetic modules and their approximate versions. This open-source library facilitates research and development in approximate computing at higher abstraction levels, and to facilitate reproducible research and comparisons.
